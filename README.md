# Classification of forest cover type

### This project is part of the **Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow** course in Codecademy.
### The data set cover-data.csv has been zipped for size upload convenience.
### The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model in order to predict forest cover type based only on cartographic variables. 
### The covertypes are the following: Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood/Willow, Aspen, Douglas-fir, Krummholz.

#### The project was developed in Jupyter Notebook, using the dataset that was provided by the platform.
